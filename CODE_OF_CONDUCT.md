# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers of Contrax pledge to make participation in the project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, level of experience, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, body size, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity/orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing opinions, perspectives and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and assistance
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the DAO
* Showing empathy towards other community members and outsiders

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcomed sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Publishing others' private information (doxing), such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission to do so
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a traditional professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior, and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions
that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Additionally, they have the right to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both in the project space and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project and/or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project email
address, posting from an official social media account, acting as an appointed
representative for an online or offline event, and so on. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at support@contrax.co. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in the response deemed necessary at the time. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality in regard to the reporter of any given incident. Further details on specific enforcement policies may be added in the future.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project's team and other contributors.
